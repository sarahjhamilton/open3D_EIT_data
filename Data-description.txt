Please see above manuscript for a more detailed description of the experimental protocol and tank design including electrode composition and locations.


-----------------------------------------
Experimental Setup:
-----------------------------------------
A 3D tank was constructed using 3/8 inch thick Plexiglas (interior dimensions 17.0cm x 25.5cm x 17.0cm) with 32 electrodes made from 16-gauge stainless steel of size 8cm x 8cm.  The top was removable to allow for the filling and removal of interior objects.

The tank was filled with tap water, s=24 mS/m, so as to generate fairly large voltages.  The optimal current patterns were determined and are denoted "opt" in the filenames.  


Note that currents were applied on all electrodes simultaneously and measured on all electrodes (including injecting electrodes).

1Targ experiment: A conductive agar sphere was placed in the corner where electrodes 4, 10, 11 intersect by standing the sphere on a tripod of toothpicks. The target was effectively "centered" in the subregion.  The water (24 mS/m) was filled to the top and the top of the tank reattached.  The optimal, trig, and haar current patterns were each applied in turn and their corresponding voltages recorded.

2Targ experiment: A second conductive agar sphere of the same material was then added to the 3, 8, 9 corner, again standing on a tripod of toothpicks.  The water (24 mS/m) was filled to the top and the top of the tank reattached.  The optimal, trig, and haar current patterns were each applied in turn and their corresponding voltages recorded.


Finally, the targets were removed, the tank filled again with the same 24 mS/m water and the voltages were measured corresponding to the "optimal" current patterns as well as the standard trigonometric current patterns.

Files:
-----------------------------------------

The following files are included for the voltage and current patterns.


Tap Water only (saline)
ACT5_05282021_100_saline_opt_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "optimal" current patterns).
ACT5_05282021_100_saline_trig_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "trig" current patterns).


1 Spherical Targets
ACT5_05282021_100_1targ_opt_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "optimal" current patterns).
ACT5_05282021_100_1targ_trig_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "trig" current patterns).
ACT5_05282021_100_1targ_haar_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "haar" current patterns).

2 Spherical Targets
ACT5_05282021_100_2targ_opt_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "optimal" current patterns).
ACT5_05282021_100_2targ_trig_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "trig" current patterns).
ACT5_05282021_100_2targ_haar_gr.mat 	(data corresponding to applying the "haar" current patterns).

-------------------------------------------------------
Each ACT5_05282021..... file contains two data variables
- current_patterns (32x31 matrix) corresponding to the current patterns applied. The ROWS correspond to the ELECTRODE number and each column is for a different current pattern applied.

- frame_voltage (32x31x100 tensor) corresponding to the voltages for the currents applied.  100 frames of data were collected.  

*** Note that currents were applied on all electrodes simultaneously and voltages were measured on all electrodes (including injecting electrodes). To ensure that the injected currents are summed to zero, a ground electrode was attached to electrode 21. The voltages have since been processed to have a mean of zero for each current pattern (i.e. sum(frame_voltage(:,CP,nn)) = 0 for each current pattern (CP) and frame (nn)).  Furthermore, only the real part of the voltages are included in the files.
